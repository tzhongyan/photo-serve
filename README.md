# THIS PROJECT IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE!
This project is originally a component for my other school project. Since that project could be deemed finished, I will not maintain this project anymore. *(Is anyone even seeing this?)*

You can still use/fork this application, but please be aware of the components used might be outdated and subject to vulnerabilities.

# photo-serve
- ~~Source code for simple node app that is running on https://pic.tzhongyan.com/.~~ *Site removed due to lack of funds.*
- Uses express and mutler
- Gets a file upload and returns the hashed link. Serves it as well.

# Bug
It didn't check for photos only, it serves all types of files. 

# License
